# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnosis using Logistic Regression
This project implements logistic regression to classify breast cancer diagnoses based on various features. It utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, available in data.csv.

### Overview
The project involves:

- Data preprocessing using pandas.
- Model training and evaluation using logistic regression.
- Comparison of results with sklearn's logistic regression implementation.

### Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Files
- `data.csv`: Contains the dataset.
- `Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnosis using Logistic Regression.ipynb`: Main Python script implementing logistic regression and model evaluation.

### Implementation Details
- Data is preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns and normalizing features.
- The logistic regression model is trained using gradient descent with forward and backward propagation.
- Model performance is evaluated using train and test accuracy metrics.
